## Selected Student Feedback

> *Professor Sacher consistently went above and beyond to ensure that his students had a complete
> understanding of the rigorous material covered in FIN 367. As someone that took this course during
> the summer to pursue an early graduation, I was deeply impressed by his ability to teach a wide
> range of complex topics in a highly compressed time frame. Despite balancing his own PhD studies
> at the McCombs School of Business, he was highly responsive and always returned graded assignments
> with detailed, thoughtful feedback, often within two days of submission. His passion for the subject
> was evident in every lecture, and I truly benefitted from his professional expertise.*

> *Professor Sacher was extremely enthusiastic and brought positive energy to each class. He encouraged
> open participation and made a strong effort to help us succeed.*

> *Always really patient and great at explaining concepts in a way that helped me to understand.*
