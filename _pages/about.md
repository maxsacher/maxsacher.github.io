  We construct a county-level measure of exposure to potential conservation efforts using
  machine learningâ€“based habitat suitability models. Exploiting the 30-by-30 initiative as a
  plausibly exogenous shock, we find that a one standard deviation increase in regulatory risk
  raises house prices by 0.6%. Effects are weaker in counties reliant on nature-based industries
  but stronger in land-abundant counties where supply is more elastic and demand for nature
  amenities is high. We find evidence that the price increase is magnified by speculation. Our
  results suggest that while conservation efforts satisfy demand for nature, they also pose
  trade-offs for local economic growth and housing affordability, with speculation amplifying
  these effects.
