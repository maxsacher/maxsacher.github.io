      We construct a county-level measure of exposure to potential conservation efforts using
      machine learning–based habitat suitability models. Exploiting the 30-by-30 initiative as a
      plausibly exogenous shock, we find that a one standard deviation increase in regulatory risk
      raises house prices by 0.6%. Effects are weaker in counties reliant on nature-based industries
      but stronger in land-abundant counties where supply is more elastic and demand for nature
      amenities is high. We find evidence that the price increase is magnified by speculation. Our
      results suggest that while conservation efforts satisfy demand for nature, they also pose
      trade-offs for local economic growth and housing affordability, with speculation amplifying
      these effects.
