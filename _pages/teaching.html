## Previous Teaching

- **FIN 367: Investment Management**  
  University of Texas at Austin, Summer 2025  


## Selected Student Feedback
``Professor Sacher consistently went above and beyond to ensure that his students had a complete understanding of the rigorous material covered in FIN 367. As someone that took this course during the summer to pursue an early graduation, I was deeply impressed by his ability to teach a wide range of complex topics in a highly compressed time frame. Despite balancing his own PhD studies at the McCombs School of Business, he was highly responsive and always returned graded assignments with detailed, thoughtful feedback, often within two days of submission. His passion for the subject was evident in every lecture, and I truly benefitted from his professional expertise.''\
